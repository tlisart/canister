# Canister generative art engine
This project is a small C project for me to experiment with pixel manipulation
and image/video generation. I try to make it minimalist, such as only one ```.h```
header file import is necessary. At this point, only 2D support is expected. The
main implementations are :

 * 2D cellular automaton systems
 * Physics based and biological simulations
 * Post-processing algorithms
 * Data-driven visualization
 * Machine-learning generation (Neural nets)
